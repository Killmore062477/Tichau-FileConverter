Let's say you like to take photos with your camera and then, you want to send it to your friends via email.
You need to send 3 or 4 emails because each photo file is quite heavy, but your friends don't care about having an awesome super high definition photography ... 
So it's quite useless and boring to make multiple emails.

# Create a custom preset

Let's create a simple preset that will resize your photo files in two clicks.

1. Open the file converter settings using the shortcut in the windows start menu (or via the context menu).

2. Right-click on the preset list and select 'New Preset' to create a new preset (you can also duplicate an existing one by right clicking on it).

3. Your preset is now created and added to the top of the list. You can now give a name to your preset.

4. You can adjust the position of your preset in the context menu by change its position in the preset list (drag and drop it where you want).

5. You can define the settings of your preset (how it will be converted) in the "Output format" section (central panel).

6. You can then define on which file type your preset will appear (in the context menu) by checking (or unchecking) the file extensions in the "input formats" section (right panel).

7. Here we want to convert only the png image files to the same file type while reducing the size of the image to 25% (in order to have a lighter file).

8. *Optional:* You can specify what File Converter will do with the input file when the conversion succeeds bellow the "Input format list". In our case, we want to delete the input file and only keep the reduced version (more informations [here](https://github.com/Tichau/FileConverter/wiki/Input-file-post-conversion-actions)).

9. Save your new preset by clicking on the save button (bottom right of the window).

## Enjoy!

You have now access to your custom preset in the File Converter menu on all png files.
